Adapted from Frazier et al. (2025) Research Experience Frustrated Magnetism and Unvoncentional Superconductivity: [Pub. 4 and 5]\nEmployed a combination of symmetry analysis and T-matrix formalism to demonstrate that coupling itinerant electrons to a noncollinear classical exchange field can induce anisotropic Josephson couplings between superconducting d-vectors, analogous to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\u0026rsquo;s anisotropic superexchange in magnetism. Demonstrated that noncollinear spin textures can generate spin triplet pairing correlations, produce a Josephson diode effect, and can favor a spatially varying superconducting order, which can lead to anomalous vortices for nonunitary pairing order. Novel States of a Spinor Superconductor: [Pub. 3]\nStudied a class of topological pairing order with Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry arising from pairing states from Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by odd integers. Analyzed the nontrivial surface states of a lattice model of a spinor superconductor, which violates Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem due to broken U(1) symmetry, and showed that the superfluid velocity obeys a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation. Monopole Superconductivity: [Pub. 2]\nInvestigated monopole harmonic superconductivity, a class of topological many-body order in which Cooper pairs carry nontrivial geometric phase. Utilized symmetry principles, exact diagonalization, and many-body techniques to propose a set of phase-sensitive probes to distinguish monopole superconductors from other unconventional superconductors.
